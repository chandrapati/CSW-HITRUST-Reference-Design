# Cisco Secure Workload — HITRUST CSF v11
## Reference Design | Certifiable Security & Privacy Programs

**Version:** 1.0  
**Use Case:** Fresh Install, Hybrid Environment (On-Prem + Cloud)  
**Framework Reference:** HITRUST CSF v11 (MyCSF / assessed programs)

---

> **Coverage legend** — this reference design and its compliance report use three words:
> - 🟢 **Direct** — CSW produces the primary evidence artifact.
> - 🟠 **Supporting** — CSW produces an input that feeds or complements another control.
> - ⚪ **Evidence Required** *(supplied outside CSW)* — CSW produces nothing here; the item is in scope for compliance but out of scope for CSW, so the customer evidences it via another control, tool, or process. A scope boundary, not a gap or "unsupported."

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Organisations pursuing **HITRUST certification or
re-certification** (healthcare, payer, SaaS, business associates) and
security architects implementing **assessment level** obligations across
harmonised controls drawn from **HIPAA**, **ISO 27001**, **NIST SP 800-53**,
**PCI DSS**, and related sources.

**Questions this reference design helps you answer:**

- *How do I demonstrate **continuous technical enforcement** for network
  segregation and connection control—not only annual policy PDFs?*
  (01.m, 01.n, 01.o)
- *What machine-generated evidence supports **monitoring of system use**
  and **administrator / operator traceability** between assessments?*
  (09.ab, 09.ad)
- *How does **ADM** help with **security requirements analysis** and
  dependency mapping during design changes or M&A integrations?* (10.a)
- *Where do **CVE awareness + reachability** strengthen **control of
  technical vulnerabilities** between scans and patch cycles?* (10.m)
- *What forensic-ready exports support **reporting information security
  events** and **collection of evidence** during incidents?* (11.a, 11.c)

**What you'll need.** Your **HITRUST scope** (systems, facilities, cloud),
the **selected assessment levels** (e.g., e1, i1, r2) for in-scope
requirements, PRS/statement mappings from your assessor or MyCSF export,
and **cross-walks** to any organization-specific control IDs.

**Where to start.** Sections 1–2 for framing; 3–6 for deployment; 7 for
**requirement-level** mapping to CSW; 8 for boundaries; 9–10 for evidence;
Appendix A for **assessment levels**; Appendix B for **cross-framework**
runbook pointers.

## CSW primer — if you are new to Cisco Secure Workload

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) is a **workload protection platform**. A lightweight **agent** on each server/VM/container observes processes and network flows; **cloud connectors** add AWS/Azure/GCP inventory where agents are not deployed.

| CSW term | Meaning | Why compliance teams care |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| **Scope** | Logical boundary (CDE, PHI zone, CUI enclave) | Defines the systems you must prove are isolated |
| **Label / filter** | Tag or query assigning workloads to scopes | Automates scope membership — reduces drift |
| **ADM** | Application Dependency Mapping from observed traffic | **Live** network/data-flow diagram for assessors |
| **Workspace** | Policy container for one scope or application | Where allow/deny rules are authored |
| **Monitor → Simulation → Enforce** | Safe rollout sequence | Simulation = change-board evidence before blocking traffic |
| **Denied Connections** | Log of flows blocked by policy | Primary proof that enforcement **operates** |

**Console areas:** Investigate (inventory, flows, vulns) · Defend/Segmentation (policy) · Manage (agents) · Platform (connectors) · Administration (audit log)

## Universal evidence workflow

Execute these phases for **this framework's** compliance boundary. Map exports to control IDs in the **Reporting & Evidence** section below.

| Phase | Goal | Key CSW actions | Typical duration |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1 — Coverage** | Every in-scope workload in CSW | Install agents/connectors; apply compliance labels; create scope | Days 1–10 |
| **2 — Baseline** | Machine-generated flow map | Run ADM ≥2 weeks; export clusters; app-owner signoff | Days 11–28 |
| **3 — Policy** | Designed isolation before enforce | Build workspace; Simulation mode; fix false positives | Days 29–45 |
| **4 — Operate** | Continuous proof between audits | Enforce; quarterly export pack; ADM refresh every 90 days | Ongoing |

### Phase 1 checklist (coverage)

- [ ] In-scope host list reconciled to CSW Inventory (100% or documented exceptions)
- [ ] Labels applied: `compliance:<framework>`, `data:<classification>`, `env:<tier>`
- [ ] CSW scope created matching compliance boundary
- [ ] **Export:** inventory CSV + agent status screenshot

### Phase 2 checklist (baseline)

- [ ] ADM running on compliance scope for full business cycle (≥2 weeks)
- [ ] Unexpected flows documented (shadow IT, vendor egress, scope creep)
- [ ] App owners signed cluster-to-application mapping
- [ ] **Export:** ADM diagram + flow samples with process context

### Phase 3 checklist (policy)

- [ ] Default-deny posture defined for sensitive scope
- [ ] ADM-imported rules refined; Simulation run ≥1 week
- [ ] Change tickets for false-positive fixes; exception register updated
- [ ] **Export:** policy export + simulation report

### Phase 4 checklist (operate)

- [ ] Enforcement enabled on pilot scope; negative test recorded in Denied Connections
- [ ] Quarterly pack: inventory, policy, denies, vulns, audit log (see playbook)
- [ ] SIEM integration verified (sample events)
- [ ] **Export:** enforcement screenshot + quarterly binder

### What CSW evidence does not replace

Physical access, HR/training records, encryption key management, signed BAAs/vendor contracts, formal pen tests, and assessor attestation still require separate programmes. CSW addresses the **workload-resident** slice: segmentation, flows, process context, vuln reachability, and change drift.

---

## CSW effectiveness for this framework

- Harmonized HIPAA+ISO+NIST+PCI evidence in one scope model
- e1/i1/r2 assessment level guidance
- Single workload evidence source for multiple inherited controls

**Compared to manual programmes:** static diagrams and annual firewall samples age immediately; CSW ties evidence to **live workload behaviour** and produces queryable exports on demand — supporting "operating effectively" language in PCI v4.0, SOC 2 CC7, and HIPAA risk analysis.

---

## 1. Overview

**HITRUST CSF v11** is a **certifiable** control framework that **harmonises**
multiple regulatory and standards baselines. CSW contributes **technical
and operational evidence** where controls expect **network segregation,
connection control, continuous monitoring of workloads, vulnerability
context, and forensic visibility**—without replacing governance, risk
analysis, privacy programme elements, or assessor judgement.

### 1.1 HITRUST Harmonisation Context

| Harmonised Baseline (Examples) | Role in Typical HITRUST Engagement |
|---|---|
| HIPAA Security Rule | Healthcare privacy/security posture |
| ISO/IEC 27001 / 27002 | ISMS-aligned management system evidence |
| NIST SP 800-53 | Control depth for federal-style rigour |
| PCI DSS | Payment environments inside hybrid scope |
| NIST CSF / others (per your factor analysis) | Risk program alignment |

> **Cross-reference:** This repo includes dedicated CSW runbooks for
> [HIPAA](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/HIPAA/CSW-HIPAA-Technical-Runbook.md),
> [ISO/IEC 27001:2022](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/ISO-27001-2022/CSW-ISO27001-Technical-Runbook.md),
> [NIST SP 800-53](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/NIST-800-53/CSW-NIST-800-53-Technical-Runbook.md), and
> [PCI DSS v4.0](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/PCI-DSS-v4/CSW-PCI-DSS-Technical-Runbook.md). Use them when
> your HITRUST statement explicitly cites those underlying requirements.

### 1.2 HITRUST Domain Themes → CSW Capabilities (Summary)

| CSF Domain Theme (Illustrative) | Representative Topics | Relevant CSW Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| **01** — Network / connectivity | Segregation, connection & routing control | Microsegmentation, policy enforcement, flow visibility |
| **06** — Data management | Protection, handling mapping | Data-flow mapping (technical), isolation enforcement |
| **09** — Monitoring & logging | System use, privileged activity evidence | Continuous monitoring, process telemetry, exports |
| **10** — Vulnerability / change | Requirements analysis, technical vulnerability mgmt | ADM, CVE + reachability, drift signals |
| **11** — Incident mgmt | Reporting, evidence handling | Forensic timelines, snapshots, integrations |

> **Notation:** Requirement identifiers such as **01.m** follow common HITRUST
> short-form references used in assessment discussions. **Confirm exact PRS text
> and keys** in your MyCSF/MyCSF export—HITRUST wording evolves by release and
> factor analysis.

---

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] **HITRUST scope** document current (systems, sites, cloud accounts,
      outsourced functions)
- [ ] **Assessment levels** selected per requirement (e.g., e1 / i1 / r2—see
      Appendix A) and agreed with assessor
- [ ] **Data classification** map available for in-scope workloads
- [ ] CSW cluster online; connectivity from workloads (typically **443
      outbound**)
- [ ] Sensor support matrix validated for all **in-scope OSes / containers**
      (per vendor guidance)
- [ ] Cloud connectors (AWS/Azure/GCP) configured if workloads are IaaS/PaaS
- [ ] Stakeholders: Risk owner, ISO, SOC/IR, GRC tooling admin, platform owners
- [ ] Change approvals for **monitoring-first** deployment (no Day-1 enforcement)

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Sensor Deployment (Days 1–7)

### 3.1 Standard Agent Deployment (Linux Example)

```bash
# RHEL/CentOS family
sudo rpm -ivh tet-sensor-<version>.rpm

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dpkg -i tet-sensor-<version>.deb

# Health check (service name may vary by packaging)
systemctl status csw-agent || systemctl status tetration-agent
```

**Day-1 posture**

| Control | Value |
|---|---|
| Enforcement | **Off / Monitoring** |
| Labels | `compliance:hitrust`, `hitrust-scope:in` |
| Collection | Flow + process (+ vulnerability where licensed) |

### 3.2 Cloud / Agentless Augmentation

```
CSW UI → Platform → External Orchestrators
  → Connect cloud accounts (least privilege)
  → Enable flow telemetry pathways (e.g., VPC/VNet flow logs) where used
```

### 3.3 Coverage Validation

```
CSW UI → Manage → Agents
  → Filter labels: hitrust-scope=in
  → Confirm 100% of production in-scope instances **active** (target)
```

**Evidence:** Screenshot or API export of agent inventory + version compliance.

---

## 4. Phase 2 — Scope & Segmentation Design (Days 5–14)

### 4.1 Scope Hierarchy (Example)

```
Root Scope
└── HITRUST-In-Scope
    ├── PHI-Production (if healthcare data present)
    ├── PCI-CDE-Connected (if card data adjacent)
    ├── Enterprise-Critical (shared services — justify narrowing)
    └── Sandboxed-DevTest (usually policy-parity, non-prod evidence optional)
```

Align scopes to **risk tiers** in your HITRUST **risk analysis** record.

### 4.2 Labels for Assessment Traceability

| Label | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hitrust-scope` | in \| out \| dual |
| `data-class` | phi \| pii \| confidential \| public |
| `tier` | critical \| high \| medium |
| `owner` | team accountable for control operation |

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Visibility, Baseline & ADM (Days 7–35)

### 5.1 Application Dependency Mapping (10.a — Security Requirements Analysis)

CSW **ADM** validates **as-designed vs as-observed** connectivity—critical
when HITRUST expects evidence of **security requirements analysis** during
architecture changes.

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Application Dependency Mapping
  → Workspace: "HITRUST-ADM-Baseline"
  → Scope: HITRUST-In-Scope (start broad; refine)
  → Window: ≥2–4 weeks
  → Enable process context; user context where supported
```

**Workflow**

1. Export cluster + edge inventory.  
2. Compare to **approved connection matrix / data-flow diagrams**.  
3. File **exceptions** or **change records** for every undocumented path.  
4. Promote refined scopes and policy candidates.

### 5.2 Network Segregation Visibility (01.m / 01.n / 01.o)

| Requirement | CSW Angle | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **01.m** Segregation in networks | Workload-level **segmentation**; deny lateral movement by default in-policy | Policy exports; ADM before/after |
| **01.n** Network connection control | **Allowlists** tied to apps/services; deny/residual logging | Enforcement + violation stats |
| **01.o** Network routing control | **Observed routing outcomes** via flows (what actually connected, on which ports) | Flow searches; path over time |

> **Assessment level nuance:** Higher **i1/r2** rigour often expects **ongoing**
> validation artifacts, not a one-time screenshot—schedule quarterly ADM refresh.

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy Design, Enforcement & Monitoring (Days 25–60)

### 6.1 Policy Workspace

```
CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation
  → Workspace: "HITRUST-Technical-Enforcement"
  → Import ADM rules → shrink to **authorised** edges only
  → Simulation → phased enforcement
```

### 6.2 Illustrative Policy Snippets (Logical)

**Segregation baseline (default deny between tiers):**

```yaml
rules:
  - name: Deny-High-to-PHI-Lateral
    action: DENY
    source:
      labels: { tier: medium }
    destination:
      labels: { data-class: phi }
```

**Connection control (service allowlist):**

```yaml
rules:
  - name: Allow-Approved-Web-To-API
    action: ALLOW
    source:
      labels: { app-tier: web }
    destination:
      labels: { app-tier: api }
    services:
      - protocol: TCP
        ports: [443]
```

**Monitoring-first alert on novel dependency:**

```yaml
rules:
  - name: Log-New-EastWest-Unapproved
    action: ALERT
    source:
      scope: HITRUST-In-Scope
    destination:
      scope: HITRUST-In-Scope
    match: not_in_adm_baseline: true
```

## 7. Phase 5 — Control-by-Control Mapping (CSF v11 Statements — Key User References)

> Replace bracketed notes with your **exact PRS identifiers** from MyCSF.
> **Assessment columns** show how rigour typically **ramps** from **e1 → i1 → r2**
> for technical evidence depth (see Appendix A).

| HITRUST Ref | Statement Theme (Short) | CSW Capability | Evidence Produced | Typical Level Expectation* |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **01.m** | Segregation in networks | **Microsegmentation** (allowlist/deny between labels/scopes); **ADM** proves intended isolation | Policy exports; ADM diffs; violation reports | **e1:** design + samples; **i1/r2:** recurring automated exports, drift detection |
| **01.n** | Network connection control | **Enforcement** of authorised services/ports; logging of denials | Enforcement mode history; connection control dashboards | **i1/r2:** stronger continuous proof |
| **01.o** | Network routing control | **Flow-based visibility** of **effective** paths; multi-hop context via telemetry | Time-bounded flow searches; top-talkers & new edges | **r2:** often pairs with formal residual risk treatment |
| **06.d** | Data protection & privacy (technical facets) | **Data-flow mapping** at workload layer; **isolation** between classes | Flow maps tagged by `data-class`; segregation policies | Pair with **privacy** artifacts (RoPA, DPIA) external to CSW |
| **09.ab** | Monitoring system use | **Continuous monitoring** of flows/processes; anomaly detection | 24×7 monitoring exports; alert routing to SOC | Integrate with SIEM narrative |
| **09.ad** | Administrator & operator logs | **Process + identity context** on admin tooling paths; forensics exports | Admin-path flow bundles; operator session timelines | Correlate with IdP / privileged access logs |
| **10.a** | Security requirements analysis | **ADM + change reviews** for requirements validation | Before/after ADM on change tickets; architecture review pack | Strong fit for **design-stage** evidence |
| **10.m** | Control of technical vulnerabilities | **CVE visibility + reachability**; policy **compensations** | Scoped vulnerability reports; exposure ranked by workload criticality | Combine with patch SLAs |
| **11.a** | Reporting information security events | **Incident evidence**: flows/processes for IOC timeboxes | IR exports + ticketing references | CSW supports **evidence**, not IR governance alone |
| **11.c** | Collection of evidence | **Forensic snapshots** (flows/process/policy versions) | Signed export packages; hash manifests | Chain-of-custody alignment |

\* **Typical expectation** varies by **assessor interpretation**, **organizational risk**,
and **selected factors**—treat this column as planning guidance, not a guarantee.

---

## 8. Boundaries — What CSW Does **Not** Cover

| Topic | Boundary |
|---|---|
| **HITRUST certification decision** | Only HITRUST / external assessors certify; CSW supplies artifacts. |
| **Policy & programme documents** | Policies, standards, SoA, risk register **narratives** remain GRC tasks. |
| **Privacy-specific legal controls** | DPIA, lawful basis, consent, BAAs/DPA execution—legal/privacy teams. |
| **Cryptographic implementations** | Algorithm selection, key ceremony, HSM governance—outside CSW. |
| **Endpoint AV / EDR** | CSW complements but does not replace traditional malware controls. |
| **Vulnerability scanning tools** | CSW contextualises exposure; **authenticated scans** may still be required. |
| **Physical security** | Facilities, badges, cameras—out of scope. |

---

## 9. Audit Preparation & Evidence Export

### 9.1 HITRUST-Friendly Evidence Catalogue (Technical)

| Evidence | CSW Source | Useful For (Examples) |
|---|---|---|
| Inventory & label posture | Manage → Inventory | 01.m / baseline scoping |
| Segmentation policy + versions | Defend → Segmentation | 01.m / 01.n |
| ADM reports (time-stamped) | Investigate → ADM | 01.o / 10.a |
| Flow exports (samples + population stats) | Flow Search | 06.d / 09.ab |
| Process / admin path exports | Process Search | 09.ad |
| Vulnerability + reachability | Vulnerability views | 10.m |
| Alert history & SOC tickets | Alerts / integrations | 11.a |
| Forensic bundles | Combined export + hashes | 11.c |

### 9.2 Bash / Packaging Example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
CYCLE="2026-05-HITRUST"
OUT="hitrust_tech_evidence_${CYCLE}"
mkdir -p "${OUT}"

# Replace with supported CSW automation:
# csw inventory export --labels hitrust-scope=in > "${OUT}/inventory.json"
# csw policy export --workspace HITRUST-Technical-Enforcement > "${OUT}/policy.json"
# csw adm export --workspace HITRUST-ADM-Baseline > "${OUT}/adm_edges.csv"

(
  cd "${OUT}"
  find . -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 sha256sum
) > "${OUT}/SHA256SUMS.txt"

echo "Transmit ${OUT} via approved secure file transfer; retain manifest."
```

### 9.3 SIEM & Ticketing Integration

- Forward **alerts** and **high-signal logs** using CSW-supported integrations
  (Splunk, QRadar, Sentinel, Chronicle, etc.—per deployment).
- Always store **correlation IDs** linking SIEM events ↔ CSW investigation UUIDs.

---

## 10. Vulnerability & Compensating Controls (10.m Depth)

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Vulnerability Report
  → Scope: HITRUST-In-Scope + tier=critical
  → Sort: Reachable from untrusted labels first
  → Export for risk committee review
```

**Compensating pattern (illustrative):**

```yaml
rules:
  - name: Compensate-Critical-CVE-442-limit-peers
    action: ALLOW
    source:
      labels: { app-tier: trusted-integrators }
    destination:
      hosts: [db-prod-01]
    services:
      - protocol: TCP
        ports: [5432]
```

Document **time-bound** compensations with **owners** and **expiry** in your
HITRUST risk register.

---

## 11. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Treating **ADM once** as perpetual truth | Quarterly or **change-triggered** reruns |
| Over-segmenting **shared services** | Design **narrow broker** roles; avoid brittle allowlists |
| Confusing **network diagrams** with **observed flows** | Lead assessors with **ADM + flows** side-by-side |
| Missing **container** inventory | Deploy supported visibility for orchestrated workloads |
| Weak **change record** linkage | Tie tickets → policy version bumps |

---

## Appendix A — Assessment Levels (e1, i1, r2)

HITRUST engagements commonly frame **progressive assurance** across
requirements. **Exact definitions** are contractually specified in HITRUST
methodology and your **MyCSF** program settings. **Practical technical
interpretation** for CSW evidence:

| Level | Short Label (Colloquial) | How CSW Evidence Usually Shows Up |
|---|---|---|
| **e1** | **Established** baseline | **Policies + sample exports** showing controls exist; point-in-time **inventory** |
| **i1** | **Implemented** with ongoing operation | **Scheduled** exports, dashboards, alert routing proofs; **months** of history |
| **r2** | **Risk-based** maturity depth | **Continuous** drift detection, robust exception handling, **trend** metrics, integration with enterprise GRC |

> Always validate level selection with your **HITRUST assessor**—programs vary by
> **industry factor analysis** and **relief** choices.
